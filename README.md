# Google Play CrawlerGoogle Play Crawler is able to automatically and efficiently crawl the detail information of Android apps on Google Play.# ArchitectureThe architecture of this project is depicted in the following figure.<img src="accessory/architecture.png" height="480" />Key points of this project are detailed below:## FeederEvery Android app on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps) has a separate URL link, and this link is constructed in the format *https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=\<package_name\>*. For example, the package name of [Chrome Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome) is *com.android.chrome*, hence, the URL to access the detail of this app is *https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome*.Therefore, to crawl app detail information from Google Play, we need some feeders to produce package names. In this project, four different kinds of feeder engines are used to generate package names which are finally stored in a center database.* Top Category Feeder	Apps on Google Play fall into different categories (or genres), and for each category, there are some top apps recommended by Google Play. *Top Category Feeder* targets crawling app package names under each top category.	* Key Word Feeder		Google Play provides the ability to search apps via key word. In this project, key words are generated through performing tokenization, stemming and stop word removal on the raw text. The raw text is collected from the description of each app crawled from Google Play.	* Same Developer Feeder	An Android app developer may own many apps at the same time. Apps developed by the same developer can be accessed via the URL in this format *https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=<dev_id>* or *https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=<dev_id>*. For example, apps developed by Google Inc. can be viewed at this URL *https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5700313618786177705*. This project extracts and stores the developer id and then automatically constructs and accesses the above URL to extract more app package names.	* Similar App Feeder	When visiting the detail page of every Android app, users are recommended some similar apps at the right side. This project also extracts package names for these similar apps and then stores into database.	## Web CrawlerThe whole project is developed based on [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) and [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) to automatically access the Google Play. Selenium is used to load a web browser to allow JavaScript execution as well as simulating some behaviors including page scrolling, button click and so on. Python HTTP library *Requests* is used to get web page content without any interaction.## RabbitMQGoogle Play Crawler is developed using Producer-Consumer model based on [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). Each producer and consumer is running in a separate process, which makes it efficient to crawl web content.## Data StorageThis project uses both MySQL and MongoDB to as storages. MySQL is mainly used to store information needed by each feeder engine, and MongoDB is used to store the detail information of each crawled app. The above architecture figure has depicted each database usage.Each record in the MongoDB is showed in the following figure.<img src="accessory/mongodb.png" height="480" /># Dependencies* [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
